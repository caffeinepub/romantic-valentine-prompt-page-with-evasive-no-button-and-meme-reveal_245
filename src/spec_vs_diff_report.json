  "summary": "REQ-19 and REQ-20 appear implemented in the success view by URL-encoding the filename in the <img> src and adding onError fallback UI. However, REQ-21 cannot be confirmed from the diff because the required image file was not added (no new public asset file in the diff), and repository-wide removal/avoidance of other similarly-named image references cannot be fully verified from the provided changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Ensure the frontend static assets include the success image file in the deployable public directory at the exact path \"frontend/public/assets/generated/Kanni 14.PNG\" (capital K, space, .PNG extension), and remove/avoid any references on the success screen to other similarly-named files.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files, so the required static image file presence at the exact path cannot be verified/implemented from these changes. Also, the diff only shows updates in App.tsx and index.html, so it cannot conclusively prove there are no other references elsewhere in the repo.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: \"Added: 0\" (no new asset file added)",
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (only shows reference to encoded \"Kanni 14.PNG\")",
