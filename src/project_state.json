  "architectural_notes": [
    "Implement as a self-contained HTML/CSS/JS page suitable for running locally in mobile/desktop browsers (Chrome/Safari).",
    "Ensure the evasive “No” interaction uses mobile-friendly events (pointerdown/touchstart) and repositions randomly while keeping the button within viewport bounds.",
    "Support swapping the Yes-result image with a user-provided static asset (stored locally with the frontend assets and referenced directly).",
    "Success/result view must reference and display only the exact user-provided attached image asset (no substitutions or generated placeholders).",
    "Success/result view after clicking “Yes” must display ONLY the exact user-attached image file (kanni 14.PNG) and must not show any other/AI/generated placeholder images.",
    "User confirmed the required success image filename is exactly \"Kanni 14.PNG\"; treat filename as case-sensitive and reference it exactly in the success/result view asset path."

  "known_issues": [
    "Result view is displaying an incorrect image after clicking “Yes” instead of the exact user-provided attached image; needs to render the provided static asset reliably.",
    "Conflicting asset requirement: project state/imageRequirements mention swapping success image to “kanni 14-1.PNG”, but user explicitly mandates displaying only the attached “kanni 14.PNG” on the Yes-result view.",
    "The required success image file (\"kanni 14.PNG\") is missing/not present in the project’s assets directory at runtime, so the Yes-result view has nothing to load and shows no image.",
    "Potential filename case mismatch: user confirmed \"Kanni 14.PNG\" (capital K) while project references \"kanni 14.PNG\"; case-sensitive environments may fail to load the image.",
    "Build/deployment is failing with an internal configuration error (“Please inform the Caffeine team”), blocking verification of the Yes-result image display."
